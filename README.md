# Intro to Haskell: Types & Typeclasses

## Inspiration: [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

Thanks for checking out my repo! Haskell is tough to learn at first, but it really stretches your mind. You will feel more "mentally flexible" after you've started working through some Haskell code!

I've added 5 files to this repo, which are *steps* to progress through learning about types and typeclasses.

## Installation

First, if you don't have Haskell yet, you'll need to get ready to run the [The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHCI)](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/GHCi).

Assuming you're on a Mac and you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed, run the following commands:

```bash
$> brew install haskell-platform
```

To confirm that worked, try the following:
```bash
$> which ghci
```

If that returns something like `/usr/local/bin/ghci` then you're ready to rock!

## Usage

Now that we have the Haskell compiler installed, let's get inside the GHCi REPL:

```bash
$> gchi
```

From inside of GCHI, you can load each 'step' or file in this repo by the following command (just make sure the argument you give to `:load` points to the correct file location):
```bash
Prelude > :load step_1_make_the_deck.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( step_1_make_the_deck.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
```
Awesome - now you can mess around with the newly-compiled Haskell program, for example:
```bash
Prelude > :t Squirtle
Squirtle :: Pokemon
Prelude > :k Suit
Suit :: *
Prelude > :k CardValue
CardValue :: *
Prelude > :t deck
deck :: [(CardValue, Suit)]
Prelude > :type Diamond
Diamond :: Suit
Prelude > :type Queen
Queen :: CardValue
Prelude > :kind Suit
Suit :: *
Prelude > :kind CardValue
CardValue :: *
Prelude > :t Pikachu
Pikachu :: Pokemon
Prelude > :t deck
deck :: [(CardValue, Suit)]
Prelude > show Jigglypuff
"Jigglypuff"
```

## Follow the steps!
You're well on your way! From here, just follow the files as steps:
```bash
Î» > :load step_2_make_deck_smarter.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( step_2_make_deck_smarter.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
```
In each file/step, make sure you understand the new topics that get introduced.
